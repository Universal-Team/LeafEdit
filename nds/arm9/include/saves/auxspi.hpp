// This is a handy typedef for nonstandard SPI buses, i.e. games with some
//  extra hardware on the cartridge. The following values mean:
// AUXSPI_DEFAULT: A regular game with no exotic hardware.
// AUXSPI_INFRARED: A game with an infrared transceiver.
//  Games known to use this hardware:
//  - Personal Trainer: Walking (aka Laufrhytmus DS, Walk With Me, ...)
//  - Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver/Black/White
// AUXSPI_BBDX: A game with what seems to be an extra protection against reading
//  out the chip. Exclusively found on Band Brothers DX.
// AUXSPI_BLUETOOTH: A game with a Bluetooth transceiver. The only game using this
//  hardware is Pokemon Typing DS.
//
// NOTE: This library does *not* support BBDX (I do have the game, but did not find the
//  time to reverse engineer this; besides, a separate homebrew for this game already exists),
//  and also *not* BLUETOOTH (the game is Japan-only, and I am from Europe. Plus I can't
//  read Japanese. And it is unlikely that this game will ever make it here.)
