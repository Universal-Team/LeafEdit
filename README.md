## Redirections
- For a list of all editable features as of latest Nightly, look [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/LeafEdit/blob/master/editing-features.md).

## Citra User
To use LeafEdit completely you need to get the assets from [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/master/builds/LeafEdit/assets/). Put the files to `sdmc:/3ds/LeafEdit/assets/` and you should be fine. You can also use the assets from the `resources/assets/` folder from this source.

## Compilation
### Setting up your enviromment

To build LeafEdit from source, you will need to setup a system with devkitARM, libctru, citro2d, citro3d, 3ds-curl and 3ds-libjpeg-turbo. Follow devkitPro's [Getting Started](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) page to install pacman, then run `(sudo dkp-)pacman -S devkitARM libctru citro2d citro3d 3ds-curl 3ds-libjpeg-turbo`. You will also need [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases/latest) and [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR/releases/latest) inside the `3ds` folder.

### Cloning the repo

To download the source you will need to clone it with submodules, this can be done by running
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Universal-Team/LeafEdit.git
```
or if you've already cloned it running 
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
to update all the submodules.

### Compiling

Simply run `make` in the LeafEdit directory.
