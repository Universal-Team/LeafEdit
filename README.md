# LeafEdit

This is a work in progress Animal Crossing: New Leaf & Wild World Save Manager & Editor for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS!

This Project has been made with [Universal-Core](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Core).

## Compilation

To build LeafEdit from source, you need devkitARM installed along with libctru, 3ds-curl, 3ds-libjpeg-turbo and 3ds-libarchive. To get these you can run `pacman -S 3ds-dev --noconfirm`, then `pacman -S 3ds-curl --noconfirm`, `pacman -S 3ds-libjpeg-turbo` and lastly `pacman -S 3ds-libarchive --noconfirm`. Now that you have everything installed, you just need to run clone the repository and run `make`.
