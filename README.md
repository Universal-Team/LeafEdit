This is a work in progress Animal Crossing: New Leaf & Wild World Save Manager & Editor for the Nintendo 3DS!

This Project has been made with [Universal-Core](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Core).

## Citra User

To use LeafEdit completely you need to get the assets from [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/master/builds/LeafEdit/assets/). Put the files to `sdmc:/3ds/LeafEdit/assets/` and you should be fine.

## Compilation

To compile LeafEdit 3DS from source, you need devkitARM installed along with libctru, 3ds-curl and 3ds-libjpeg-turbo. To get these you can run `pacman -S 3ds-dev --noconfirm`, then `pacman -S 3ds-curl --noconfirm` and lastly `pacman -S 3ds-libjpeg-turbo`. Now that you have everything installed, you just need to run clone the repository and run `make`.
